This script could result in errorous migration results. We strongly advise to clean up the database manually before starting the migration. For all the affected Images you have to do the following:<ul><li>Rename the thumbnail image in the filesystem to be the one set in the old JoomGallery image table at row 'imgfilename'.</li><li>In the old JoomGallery image table, set the value of the row 'imgthumbname' to be the same as in row 'imgfilename'.</li></ul><br/>ID's of affected images: (%s)<br/><br/>If you face any problems, call for help in our forum at https://www.forum.en.joomgalleryfriends.net"
