This script could result in errorous migration results. We strongly advise to clean up the database manually before starting the migration. For all the affected Images you have to do the following:<ul><li>Rename the thumbnail image in the filesystem to be the one set in the old JoomGallery image table at row 'imgfilename'.</li><li>In the old JoomGallery image table, set the value of the row 'imgthumbname' to be the same as in row 'imgfilename'.</li></ul><br/>ID's of affected images: (%s)<br/><br/>If you face any problems, call for help in our forum at https://www.forum.en.joomgalleryfriends.net"

This might be wrong if you renamed category titles without regenrating the alias. In this case a convertion of the old JG3- folder structure to the new one is not possible.<br />If you choose to keep the old folder structure, you have to switch on the 'JG3 compatibility mode' in the components global configuration in order for the component to find the images stored in the old folder structure style."
